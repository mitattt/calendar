## Single Page Application with React

### Used technologies
* React
* JavaScript
* SASS
* Eslint

[DEMO-LINK](https://mitattt.github.io/calendar//)

## This page contains:

```bash
   Calendar with highlighting current date, also you can add, update or delete some event.
   Added possibility to change monthes clicking on left and right buttons in the top right corner.

    P.S 
    The server was deployed on glitch platform and as you know its very luggy. 
    So if adding events does not work, please INSTALL THIS PROJECT LOCALY

    to do it you should do next:
      - clone repository
      - uncomment the BASE_URL which is localhost...
      - open console and type NPM I
      - then open 2 more consoles and type in first one "npm start"
      - in the second one type "npm run serve"

    ones it starts all have to work well.
```

The possibility of setting some time on event, and storing add date about page in locaStorage was not completed due to short deadline (im sorry for that)
